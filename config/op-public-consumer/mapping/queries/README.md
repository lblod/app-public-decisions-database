Example configuration for Organization Portal (PUBLIC) to public-decisions-database. It contains some mappings which are not used in the public producer (such as names of persons) but does not yet take all the necessary mapping into account yet for a sensitive data in OP. Mainly the pass configuration should be extended. See https://github.com/lblod/app-digitaal-loket/tree/master/config/op-consumer/mapping/queries for the original.
